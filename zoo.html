        <!--about bears-->
        <p>
          Bears are large, powerful mammals known for their thick fur and
          strong, muscular bodies. Found in various habitats from forests to
          mountains, theyâ€™re highly adaptable and skilled foragers, feeding on a
          wide diet that includes plants, berries, fish, and even small animals.
          Despite their size, some bear species can run surprisingly fast and
          are skilled climbers and swimmers.

        <h2>Giraffes</h2>
        <!--about giraffes-->
        <p>
          The giraffe is the tallest land animal, easily recognized by its long
          neck, which helps it reach leaves high in trees that other animals
          can't access. Native to African savannas, giraffes have distinctive
          spotted coats and long legs, allowing them to cover large distances in
          search of food and water. Their gentle nature and unique appearance
          make them a favorite among zoo visitors.

        <!--about lions-->
        <p>
          Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are majestic big cats famous
          for their golden coats and powerful roars. They live in social groups
          called prides, primarily in African grasslands, where they hunt in
          teams to capture prey. Lions are apex predators, and the males, with
          their iconic manes, play a protective role within their prides.

        <!--about Monkeys-->
        <p>
          Monkeys are clever, social animals often found in forests, grasslands,
          and mountains. Known for their agility, monkeys use their hands and
          tails to swing through trees with ease. They live in groups,
          communicate with various sounds, and display intelligence through
          their ability to use tools, solve problems, and learn from one
          another.

        <h2>Alligators</h2>
        <!--about alligators-->
        <p>
          Alligators are large, semi-aquatic reptiles with thick, armored skin
          and powerful jaws. Found in freshwater rivers, lakes, and swamps, they
          are skilled hunters, using stealth to ambush prey. Known for their
          impressive strength and sharp teeth, alligators are often seen basking
          in the sun to regulate their body temperature.
